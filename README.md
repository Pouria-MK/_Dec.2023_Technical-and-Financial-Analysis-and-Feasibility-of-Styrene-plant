*Conceptual Design and Simulation of Styrene Production Plant*

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete analysis of the technical design and financial feasibility of a styrene production plant. The project includes process simulations, economic assessments, and sensitivity analysis aimed at optimizing the plant's performance and evaluating its viability.

- Styrene is a key monomer for producing polymers such as polystyrene and ABS plastic, used in numerous industrial applications.
- The primary focus is on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene, an established method for styrene production.

## Key Features
- Process Simulation: Detailed simulations of the dehydrogenation process to maximize efficiency.
- Energy Optimization: Design focus on energy integration to minimize operational costs.
- Economic Evaluation: Comprehensive cost analysis including capital expenditures (CAPEX), operating expenses (OPEX), and revenue forecasts.
- Sensitivity Analysis: Impact of raw material costs, energy prices, and styrene market demand on overall plant profitability.

## Technical Aspects

- Reaction Design: Based on ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene.
- Optimization: Heat recovery and process integration to improve energy efficiency.
- Environmental Controls: Emissions reduction strategies aligned with sustainability practices.

## Financial Analysis

- Capital Investment: Breakdown of equipment, construction, and installation costs.
- Operating Costs: Labor, utilities, and maintenance expenses.
- Profitability: Revenue projections based on current market trends for styrene.
- Break-Even Analysis: Estimation of the time required for the plant to become profitable.

## Tools & Technologies
- Process Simulation Software: Aspen Plus or similar
- Economic Analysis Tools: Excel or Python for financial modeling
- Sensitivity Analysis: Scenario evaluation based on fluctuating economic and operational factors
